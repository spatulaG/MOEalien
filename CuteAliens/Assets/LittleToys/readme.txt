Hello, thank you for purchasing the Lenzo package from the Unity Asset Store. 
We hope you find the assets useful and you can make a great game with them.
We want to continue improving this package with new animations and characters, so if you
have any suggestion please drop us a line at: assetstore@phynegames.com and tell su what you
would like see.

Description:
The Lenzo package contains 7 characters(models), 36 animations, and 3 different resolutions for each texture.
Also, you will find a test scene (Scenes/AllCharacters) containing a preview of the animations and characters.


How to use the package:
- To start using the package, you simply have to import the package to your project.

- We have included prefabs(Prefabs/) with a custom animation controller and with the high resolution texture so you can just drag them
into your scene and see them working.

- If you want you can use one of the Animation Controllers we provided (AnimationControllers/) to start from there or using your own.
(Check the Mechanim documentation to know more about how to create animation trees).

Version 1.0
- Package containing 7 models and 36 animations.

Now, go and create an amazing game!
